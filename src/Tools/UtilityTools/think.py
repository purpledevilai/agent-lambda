    A reasoning tool that allows the agent to organize and articulate its thought process

    complex problems systematically.
    
    Call this tool whenever you need to:
    - Break down a complex task into smaller steps
    - Reason through what information you have vs what you need
    - Plan the sequence of API calls or actions to take
    - Analyze data or responses before deciding next steps
    - Think through edge cases or potential issues
